Description:
Program solve generating password. 
Security level requirements:
 o password length of ten characters
 o contain minimum three characters from different character groups.
Character groups are uppercase, lowercase, digits and special characters.

    Principle:
    Compare character by character in group string.

    Purpose:
    Check if the index indicates three different groups. 
    Parameters:
    'groups_index_num' has an integer data type.
    Principle:
    Create a groups index string based on groups index number.
    Eventually add zeros at the beginning to have four character length string.
    Count zeros in the index string.
    Zero indicates that password's characters has not representation in characters group.
    As we have four groups of characters, more than one zero means False return.

    True if were indicated minimum three different groups, False in other cases.
